    <h2>How to Make Chicken Katsu</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

        Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. 
        Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. 
        Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, 
        and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
