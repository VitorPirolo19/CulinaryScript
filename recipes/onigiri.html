    <h2>How to Make Onigiri</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>5 ½ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>
        Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. 
        Combine washed rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. 
        Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. 
        Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 
        15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. 
        Allow cooked rice to cool. 
    </p>

    <b>Step 2</b>
    <p>
        Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; 
        use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide cooked 
        rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri. 
    </p>

    <b>Step 3</b>
    <p>
        Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with 
        a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of rice 
        and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice 
        to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. 
        Repeat with remaining portions of rice.
