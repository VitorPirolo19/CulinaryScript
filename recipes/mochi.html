    <h1>Mochi</h1>
    <h2>What is Mochi?</h2>
    <p>
        Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour,
         or mochigome. It has a soft, chewy texture that is somewhat elastic. 
         Mochi is often flavored with matcha (or green tea powder), 
         which gives it a light green hue.

    <h2>How to make Mochi?</h2>
    <h3>Ingrendients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
        <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch, for rolling out the dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

    <b>Step 2</b>
    <p>Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid, at least 1 hour.</p>

    <b>Step 3</b>
    <p>Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a microwave-safe bowl.</p>

    <b>Step 4</b>
    <p>Stir in water, then sugar; mix until smooth.</p>

    <b>Step 5</b>
    <p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds.</p>

    <b>Step 6</b>
    <p>Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8 equal balls. Set aside.</p>

    <b>Step 7</b>
    <p>Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat, covered, for another 15 to 30 seconds.</p>

    <b>Step 8</b>
    <p>
        Dust a work surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball. 
        Flatten the ball and place one ball of frozen red bean paste in the center. Pinch and press the dough 
        around the bean paste until completely covered. 
    </p>

    <b>Step 9</b>
    <p>Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.</p>

    <b>Step 10</b>
    <p>Repeat Step 6 to make remaining mochi.</p>

    <b>Step 11</b>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
